I’m Quantilytix. I build software products and prefer direct, no-fluff answers.

Right now I’m working on SozoGraph v1, a lightweight memory object for AI agents.
I want alignment on strategy before rushing into code.

In the future, I plan to extend this to graph-based memory, but v1 must stay simple.
